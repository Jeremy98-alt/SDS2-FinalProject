## Guessing, if there is a heart attack or not

The main purpose of this analysis is to predict if a person given the main features interested in this project could have in the future a heart attack or not.

Here, there are different files but essentially we have:

- .Rmd file where you could execute the origin file
- .R file where I consider different method, so it is a test file for the .Rmd
- .html file that is generated from .Rmd
- "img" folder useful to consider the images in the main file

... and other things

So, here we used the Bayesian tools and the frequentistic tool to guess on which parameters are good for my Logistic Regression, the binary classifier that predicts 1 or 0, more details are in the files!
